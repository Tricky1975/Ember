Quick tool to convert binaries into a C constant in order to merge them into C or C++ programs

There is not much to this tool, use it as you see fit. 
NOTE, this tool is written for GCC, so Windows users will need MINGW. Visual Studio will likley NOT compile this code (because Microsoft doesn't agree with "old" C standards), although I never tried.
